  <h3>[Task 1] Deploy VM</h3>
  
  This room uses a 32-bit Windows 7 VM with Immunity Debugger and Putty preinstalled. Windows Firewall and Defender have both been disabled to make exploit writing easier.

You can log onto the machine using RDP with the following credentials: admin/password

I suggest using the xfreerdp command: 

    ✅ xfreerdp /u:admin /p:password /cert:ignore /v:MACHINE_IP
